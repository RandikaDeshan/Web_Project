				<p class="des-para">Zero Hungers? What is the meaning of that? Is it only No or empty of hungers?
It’s second SDG in goals. It is not only empty or no hungers. It is collection of End hunger, achieve food security and 
improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
In 2015, the incidence of malnutrition began to slowly increase. Current estimates put the 
number of hungry people at nearly 690 million, or 8.9 percent of the world's population - 10 
million in one year and 60 million in five years.
The world is not on track to eradicate hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number 
of people suffering from hunger by 2030 will exceed 840 million. More than 690 million 
hungry people - and an additional 2 billion people worldwide by 2050 - need a profound 
change in the global food and agricultural system. Increasing agricultural productivity and 
sustainable food production are critical to eliminating the dangers of starvation. This sdg goal 
has been created for that.
Simply the goal here is to create a society free of hunger.

				<p class="des-para">What about Sri Lanka
Current Status and Trends
Agriculture in Sri Lanka is mainly rain fed and 
irrigated. Sri Lanka also mainly exports tea, rubber, 
coconut and spices. Up to 25-30% of the population is 
dependent on Agriculture.
The national level food availability in Sri Lanka
is on the rise due to increased domestic food
production. At present, 80% of Sri Lanka’s food
requirement is produced domestically and less
than 20% is imported. Achieving near selfsufficiency in rice was one of the significant
achievements in the food crop sector in
Sri Lanka. The expanding road network and
the rising household income with a long-term
downward trend of overall poverty levels indicate
the improved physical and economic access to
food.
Gaps and Challenges
It is evident that apart from long-term and gradual changes, extreme climate conditions such 
as severe droughts and floods are frequent occurrences in Sri Lanka These threaten 
agricultural production and exacerbate the risks of food and nutrition security. 
Future food security depends on further increases in yield potential with varieties and 
associated technologies having higher input use efficiencies and resistance to biotic and 
abiotic stresses. Thus, maintaining the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, and farm 
animals through a progressive, proactive, farmer friendly and transparent system with
equitable benefit sharing for utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge is essential which is an area that requires attention.
Way Forward
Addressing the multidimensional problem of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition needs a 
multi-faceted approach, with a vast number of policy and programmatic recommendations 
required along with concrete implementation plans. These include investments in R&D, 
agriculture extension, irrigation infrastructure, modern technologies, marketing and value 
chain development, public private partnerships, disaster mitigation, and climate adaptation, as 
well as land and seed market reforms.
A new national agricultural policy document is being prepared focusing on introducing
innovative technologies to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth with an assured 
food security for the nation. The Department of Agriculture’s national food production 
programme for 2016–2018 consists of promoting the production of rice and other food crops, 
and a home-gardening programme Moreover, the Government has initiated several 
programmes for developing the dairy industry, modernizing fisheries, developing agricultural 
“mega zones” and value chains, developing public-private-producer-partnerships, and 
modernizing irrigation The development objectives of the Agriculture Sector Modernization 
Project for Sri Lanka are increasing agriculture productivity, improving market access, and 
enhancing the value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses
However, there are plenty of malnourished children in Sri Lanka as well as families who are 
unable to get a properly balanced diet. Not only that, farmers do not have much knowledge to 
carry out agricultural activities using new technologies. Food is a basic human need. So it is 
imperative to pay more attention to that. A proper system should be formulated in Sri Lanka to 
eradicate hunger.
